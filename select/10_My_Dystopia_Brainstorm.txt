Gaze into the mirror, pulling on the trigger when your dream is over,
On this dark and bloody night, the moon hangs in the sky, come closer
Haunted by the never, laughing at another true believer's suicide,
Evil forces gathering, clouds are closing in while I'm still inside.

Don't you ever say I'm losing my fate, my dystopia
Don't know why I'm here, beyond the frontier, my dystopia

All is now or never. I can feel the pressure, leading to the inside,
Doomed in plight, as misery is my worst enemy, my only guide,
With the rising of the sun a new fight has begun you can't conceal,
Warning signs already passed; nothing ever lasts the way I feel.
