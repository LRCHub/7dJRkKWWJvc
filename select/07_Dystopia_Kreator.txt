Welcome to the coldest age of darkness
Millennium deprivation, deception and deceit
Feared in presence, loathed within their absence
Feed the dogs of war to keep a fragile peace

All hail dystopia - Your parasite messiah never comes
All hail dystopia - God has died when war drags ever on
War drags ever on

Pseudo truth, perversion and religion
Disorder separates and scatters
Shepherds from the sheep
Tragedy and suicide decisions
Destroyers are not saviors in wartime misery

All hail dystopia - Your parasite messiah never comes
All hail dystopia - God has died when war drags ever on
War drags ever on
War drags ever on

Gehenna abomination
Crypts under the sun
Sacrifice the lives of those dead armies marching on and on

Dead armies marching on
Dead armies marching on
Dead armies marching on
Dead armies marching on

Dead armies marching on
Dead armies marching on
Dead armies marching on
Dead armies marching on

All hail dystopia - Your parasite messiah never comes
All hail dystopia - God has died when war drags ever on
War drags ever on
